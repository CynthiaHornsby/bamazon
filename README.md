<b>Interface:</b>

In this application you can see a print-off of the items the store has.  You can select what item you would like to buy, and type in the units you would like to purchase.  The application will check to make sure that the stock quantity is sufficient, and if it is, it will subtract that stock from the total inventory number, and add together the price to display.
